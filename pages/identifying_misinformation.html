            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Misinformation and disinformation are both forms of false information that can mislead or manipulate public perception. While misinformation refers to false or inaccurate information spread unintentionally, disinformation involves the deliberate creation and distribution of misleading or false content to deceive or manipulate audiences.

            <p><br><b class="b-bigger">Defining the Types and provinding examples:</b></p>
            <p>Misleading content can be seperated into two types: <em>misinformation</em> or <b>unintentionally misleading content</b>, and <em>disinformation</em> or content that is <b>intentionally misleading</b>.</p>
            <p class="example-h2"><br><b class="b-bigger">Misinformation:</b></p>
            <p>Satire and Parody: Satirical and parodistic content is a form of misinformation <b>created to entertain</b>; this content is not intended to harm or mislead others but has the potential to unintentionally do so (“Evaluating Information,” 2024).</p>
            <p>Sponsored Content: Sponsored content is not inherently misinformation, but it can become misleading when its <b>sponsorship is not disclosed</b> and when creators present it as purely factual rather than <b>financially influenced</b> (“Using Social Media…,” 2022).</p>
            <p>Error: Error is misinformation that occurs when <b>mistakes</b> are made by establishes agencies in their reporting. This can also occur with other sources when they <b>mistakenly report incorrect information</b> (“Using Social Media…,” 2022).</p>
            
            <p class="example-h2"><br><b class="b-bigger">Disinformation:</b></p>
            <p>Fabricated Content: Fabricated content is <b>completely false information</b> created and designed to <b>deceive the viewer.</b> One of the primary motivations a person or entity may have for creating fabricated content is to mislead people for financial or political gain (“Evaluating Information,” 2024).</p>
            <p>Manipulated Content: Manipulated content is <b>genuine information that is edited or manipulated</b> with the intention to deceive the viewer. This type of content is often in the form of photos or videos that are edited or shot in such a way as to create a false reality within them (“Evaluating Information,” 2024).</p>
            <p>Imposter Content: Imposter content is created and presented under the branding of an established agency or poses as an individual to <b>falsely attribute information to an individual.</b> This content takes advantage of people’s trust in the impersonated entity to spread false information and tends to target those less vulnerable to other attempts of deception (“Evaluating Information,” 2024).</p>
            <p>Misleading Content: Misleading content is broadly defined as misinformation <b>presented as factual</b> (“Using Social Media…,” 2022).</p>
            <p>False Context: False context is factually <b>correct information</b> that is shared with <b>false contextual information.</b> This type of disinformation can be hard to identify since authentic information is utilized, giving false credibility to the source while actually providing misleading information (“Evaluating Information,” 2024). </p>
            <p>False Connections (Clickbait): False connections are a form of misinformation packaged by titles, visuals, or captions that <b>don’t support the content.</b> False connections can also be referred to as <b>clickbait,</b> or content designed to grab your attention, regardless of whether the means to do so pertains to the actual content (“Evaluating Information,” 2024).</p>
            <p>Propaganda: Propaganda is <b>biased or misleading</b> information used to promote and/or publicize a particular <b>political</b> point of view (“Evaluating Information,” 2024). </p>

  <p>Identifying misinformation and disinformation can be tricky, but there are a few tips and tricks that can help you navigate the internet safely. Here are some key ways to spot misinformation:</p>

  </figure> -->

  <ul class="tips">
    <li>🔍 1. Check the Source</li>
      <p>Is it a legit, reputable news outlet or website?</p>

      <p>Be wary of websites with strange URLs or ones that mimic real outlets (e.g., bbc.co.com instead of bbc.com).</p>
    <li>📰 2. Read Beyond the Headline</li>
      <p>Clickbait headlines can be wildly misleading.</p>

      <p>Read the full article or post — many fakes are exposed with just a little extra context.</p>

    <li>🗣️ 3. Verify Quotes</li>
      <p>If a quote seems too wild or perfect, Google it in quotes ("like this") to check if it's been reported elsewhere.</p>

    <li>📆 4. Check the Date</li>
      <p>Sometimes old news is reshared as if it just happened — context matters.</p>

    <li>🧠 5. Use Reverse Image Search</li>
      <p>If a photo seems suspicious or dramatic, plug it into Google Images or TinEye to see where it’s been used before.</p>

    <li>👀 6. Watch for Emotional Manipulation</li>
      <p>Fabricated content often tries to provoke anger, fear, or shock.</p>

      <p>If it feels too extreme or one-sided, dig deeper.</p>

    <li>🛠️ 7. Fact-Check with Reputable Sites</li>
      <p>Use tools like:</p>
      <p class="no-margin"><ul class="tips-tools-list">
        <li>Snopes</li>
        <li>FactCheck.org</li>
        <li>PolitiFact</li>
        <li>Media Bias/Fact Check</li>
      </ul></p>

    <li>🧾 8. Look for Supporting Evidence</li>
    <p>Real stories often link to sources, documents, studies, or interviews.</p>

    <p>Lack of supporting evidence? Red flag.</p>

    <li>👤 9. Investigate the Author or Profile</li>
    <p>Is it a real person? Do they have a history of sharing credible info?</p>

    <p>Fake accounts often have low activity, weird bios, or stolen photos.</p>

    <li>🤖 10. Too Perfect or Too Polished?</li>
    <p>Deepfakes and AI-generated content often have small flaws (e.g., weird eyes, mismatched lighting, odd background details).</p>
  </ol>

 <!-- Examples -->
 <section id="examples" class="my-5">
  <h3 class="main-headers">Examples</h3>
  <p>Understanding the kinds of misinformation you may encounter is very important to navigating the internet safely, and identifying these types is equally important. Here are some common examples of each type of misinformation/disinformation to familiarize yourself with:
  </p>
  <p class="example-h1"><b>Fabricated Content</b></p>
    <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Fake News</u> - News stories created to support inaccurate information
    </p>
    <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A headline says “NASA Confirms Earth Will Go Dark for 6 Days”.</p>
    <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify: NASA never made such a statement; a quick fact-check reveals the story originated from a satirical site.</p>

    <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Deep Fakes</u> - AI-generated videos or audio that convincingly mimic real people saying or doing things they never did.</p>
    <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A video surfaces of a celebrity "endorsing" a product but in reality, it's a deepfake created using AI voice and face technology.</p>
    <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify: Slight facial glitches, unnatural blinking, or mismatched audio/visual cues.</p>
  <!-- if there is time maybe we can add photos or videos for example-->


  <p class="example-h1"><b>Manipulated Content</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Photoshopped Images</u> - Altered photos meant to deceive, like making events look more dramatic or fabricating someone's appearance or actions.</p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A photo of a politician edited to show them shaking hands with a controversial figure.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify: Reverse image search shows the original was with someone else entirely.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Cropped/Edited Videos</u> - Videos that remove valuable context from the situations being shown or gives context that wasn’t originally there</p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A clip of a protestor acting aggressively, cut in a way that removes what led up to the moment (like provocation or self-defense).</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify: Look for full versions or multiple angles from trusted outlets.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Altered Photos/Data</u> - Misleading photos of charts/data that skew the data (or interpretation of the data) for inflammatory purposes</p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A graph showing a dramatic rise in crime — but the y-axis starts at 90 instead of 0, making the increase look way worse than it is.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify: Always examine the scale and what the graph doesn't show.</p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>Imposter Content</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Fake Accounts</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> An account named @CNNBreakingNewsz posts “breaking” news about a terrorist attack. It uses CNN’s logo and branding, but it’s not CNN — just an impersonator trying to go viral or stir panic.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify:
    <br>- Username is slightly off 
    <br>- No verification badge
    <br>- New account with few posts/followers
   </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Imitation Websites</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A website that looks like BBC but is actually bbc-news24.com publishes a false story about a celebrity death.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify:
    <br>- Strange URL (contains typos, is slightly different from the original site: ex. O’s are typed as 0’s)
    <br>- No links to other trusted news outlets reporting the same thing
    <br>- Sloppy or sensational writing
    <br>- Excess of advertisements on the page
    </p>

    <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Phising Emails/Messages</u> - </p>
    <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> Someone receives a message from a number claiming to be their bank, saying their account is locked and asking for a verification code.              </p>
    <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify: Banks don’t contact you this way nor do they ask for personal codes or PINs</p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>Misleading Content</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Misleading Statistics</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A headline says: "Vaccinated People Make Up 60% of COVID Cases!" But it leaves out context: if 90% of the population is vaccinated, then this stat doesn't mean the vaccine is ineffective, it’s actually expected.
  </p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify:
    <br>- Look for the base rate or broader context
    <br>-  Ask: what’s the whole story?</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Cherry-Picked Data</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> An advertisement for a weight loss program: "100% of users saw results!" But they only used 5 hand-picked people for their "study" and ignored the other 95 who saw no effect.
  </p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify:
    <br>- No link to full study
    <br>- Words like “clinical study” without details
    <br>- Fine print may contradict the claim            </p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>False Context</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Old Image, New Claim</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A photo of flooded streets is shared during a new hurricane with the caption: "Look what Hurricane Ella did last night!" But the photo is actually from a flood years ago in a different country.            </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Misused Quotes            </u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A quote from a health expert in 2020 says: "Masks are not necessary for the general public." This quote resurfaced in 2024, ignoring that health guidelines later changed as more was learned.
  </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Wrong Geographic Context            </u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A video of a military parade is shared claiming it shows a "secret build-up of troops near the U.S. border." But it’s actually a celebration parade in Russia from years ago.
  </p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>Satire and Parody</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Parody Accounts</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A parody Twitter account like <i>@NotTheRealBiden</i> tweets: “I just signed a bill outlawing pineapple on pizza.” At a glance, it may seem that the president tweeted this.
  </p>


  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Satirical News Taken as Real</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> An Onion headline: “NASA Finds Planet Exactly Like Earth, With Same Climate Change Deniers” People screenshot it and share it without context, saying “NASA really found a new Earth!”
  </p>




  <p class="example-h1"><b>False Connections (Clickbait) </b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Overpromising Titles</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> “This One Trick Will Help You Lose 20 Pounds Overnight!” <br>📰 Actual content: It’s about drinking more water and sleeping well (not a “trick” at all).
  </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Celebrity Twist</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> “Taylor Swift Reveals Her Secret Marriage Plans!” <br>📰 Actual article: She said in an interview she might want to settle down someday.
  </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Withholding Key Info (Curiosity Gap)</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> “He Opened the Door and Instantly Regretted It…” <br>📰 Actual content: A squirrel ran into his house.
  </p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>Sponsored Content</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Ads That Look Like News Articles</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A headline on a news site says: “Doctors Stunned By New Diabetes Cure” It links to what looks like a health article, but it’s actually a paid ad for a sketchy supplement with no medical backing.
  </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Fake Expert Endorsements</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A “sponsored blog” titled: “Why This Dentist Recommends Coconut Oil Instead of Brushing” The dentist isn’t real, and the article was written by the company selling the oil.
  </p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Influencer Posts Without Disclaimers</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A wellness influencer says: “This detox tea changed my life — not sponsored, just honest truth!” But they were paid to post it, and the tea contains harmful additives.</p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>Propaganda</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Glorifying a Leader or Regime</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A poster shows a national leader in glowing light, with phrases like: “Our Great Leader Brings Peace, Strength, and Hope!”</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Propaganda: It idealizes the leader without acknowledging flaws or challenges, aiming to inspire loyalty rather than critical thinking.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Demonizing the “Enemy”</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A wartime pamphlet shows the enemy as monsters or animals, with slogans like: “They Want to Destroy Our Way of Life — Stop Them Now!”</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Propaganda:  It dehumanizes opponents, simplifying conflict into “us vs. them” and stoking fear and hatred.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Slogans and Repeated Messaging</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> Repeated messages like: “Obey. Work Hard. Support the State.”</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Propaganda: These simplistic, repetitive slogans aim to condition people through repetition rather than logic.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Manipulated Education Materials</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A school textbook says: “Our country has never done anything wrong in war. All others were aggressors.”</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Propaganda: It rewrites or omits history to build national pride and suppress critical analysis.</p>

              <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Films or Music with Hidden Political Messaging</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A patriotic film shows the military as flawless heroes and opposition groups as traitors — without any nuance.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🔍 How to Identify:  It subtly (or overtly) pushes a nationalistic or political message through entertainment.</p>



  <p class="example-h1"><b>Error</b></p>
  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Journalistic Reporting Errors</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A news outlet incorrectly reports that a celebrity has died. The story goes viral before it's corrected a few hours later.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Misinformation: The correction often doesn’t spread as far as the original mistake.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Auto-Translation Errors</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> A translated headline says: “Government bans food!” But the original article meant “certain food imports.” The translation was just off.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Misinformation: Translation errors can dramatically change meaning and spread wrong info.</p>

  <p class="example-h2 indent"><u>Misremembering a Quote or Fact</u> - </p>
  <p class="example-ex indent-more"><b>Example:</b> Someone tweets: “Einstein said, ‘Everyone is a genius.’” But there’s no real record of him saying that exact phrase.</p>
  <p class="example-hti indent-final">🧠 Why it’s Misinformation: Common misquotes or paraphrases get treated as fact and spread widely.</p>
